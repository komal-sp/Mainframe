# GDG Introduction

## What is GDG?
GDG stands for **"Genration Data Group"**, a consept in the mainframe that allows organizing and managing datasets or files over the time.
These are a group of datasets that are logically relates (with the same attribuites like format and record length) to each other from the process & usage point of view.
Genration data sets (GDSs) can be **sqeuential (PS), direct or partitioned data sets (PDS).**

# Naming of GDG?
All datasets (genrations) withing GDG share the common name except the last qualifer, which is combination of the genration number and version number.The common name is called as "**GDG Base**", and the remaining datasets with a different qualifier at the end are called as "**GDG Files or GDG Genrations**". At any point in time, a GDG can have a maximum 255 genrations.

# Absolute (full) Genration & Version Numbers -
The genration and version numbers are used to identify a specific generation of GDG. The format is -

In the above -
**- MATPEPK.TEST.GDG** is the GDG base name.
**- GmmmmVnn** is the genartion and version numbers form, where **mmmm** is a 4-digit genration number (ranges from 0001 to 9999) and **nn** is a 2-digit version number (ranges from 00 too 99).

# Relative Version Numbers-
We can also use relative generation numbers to refer the GDG datasets based on their postion from the latest GDG file. 
- For ex., X.Y.Z(-1), X.Y.Z(+1) or X.Y.Z(0)

In the above -
**- MATEPK.TEST.GDG** is the GDG base name
**- nnn** is the raltive number of the GDG genration from the latest **nnn** is a 3-digit generation number (ranges from 001 to 255).

**Example-** Let us assume we have a GDG like the one below, and we will discuss how the raltive number is used on it.

**- MATEPK.TEST.GDG(0)** refers to the latest genration. From the above example, it refers to MATEPK.TEST.GDG.G0002V00.
**-MATEPK.TEST.GDG(-nnn)** refers to the previous genartion from the latest. From the example, MATEPK.TEST.GDG(-1) refers MATEPK.TEST.GDG.G0001V00.
**-MATEPK.TEST.GDG(+nnn)** refers to the newly created genration on top of the latest genration. From the example, MATEPK.TEST.GDG(+1) refers MATEPK.TEST.GDG.G0003V00.
**+nnn** (positive relative number) is only used when creation a new generation in the JCL. For example, +1 is the first new genration, +2 is the second genration, and so on.

ðŸ“‹ Notes: All the genarations and their relative numbers are updated only at the successful run of the job, i.e, for any executiong job, the ralative numbers coded are the same until it ends. Once the job runs successfully, the generations and relative numbers are updated. If the job abends, the next version won't get created.

# Rules to remember-
- All the generations ofa GDG should have the same attributes (DCB parameters such as record length, record format and so on).
- A maximum of 255 genrations can exit within a GDG.
- GDGs should be cataloged.
- Generations of GDG should be sequential and reside on disk.
- While creating a new generation, the DISP parameter should be set to (NEW, CATLG,..).
- DSN and UNIT parameters are manfatory for creating a new genration.
- Generation data sets can not be VSAM data sets.

# Advantages
The major benefits are-
**-Organized Data Management:** GDG datasets are used to take periodic       backup (daily, weekly or monthly) of critical data for fture reference.
**-Version Control:** GDGs can be referenced using relative numbers. So, it makes the JOB run successfully every time without modifying its file names (beacause of relative numbers).
**- Memory Limit:** We can set a limit for the genrations to save the memory.
**- Simplified Referncing:** We can easily track all generations by jusr referring to the base name. Any specific genrations can be referred to easily.
**- Automativ Cleanup:** The older genrations automatically get deleted based on the options coded while creating the base
**- Consistency in Processing:** Ensures that the correct version of data is used in batch processing.

# Disadvantages
**- Complexity:** For new users, the concept and syntax of GDGs can be complex to understand. Managing GDGs can become complex as the number of genrations increases.
**- Limited Flexibility:** The rigid structure of GDGs might only fir some data management needs.
**- Space Management:** GDGs can consume excessive disk space if not managed properly.
**- Limited Scope:** GDGs are specific to mainframe environment and might not integrate with other data management systems.
**- Storage Overhead:** Keeping multiple genrations of datasets can consume significant storage resources if not managed properly.
